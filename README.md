This is my first **HTML and CSS portfolio website** project.  
It was built to showcase my identity, skills, and creativity as both a **traveler** and a **web developer**.  
The site includes multiple pages and a simple, responsive layout that adapts well across devices.

## The 5 Planes of UX

### 1. Strategy

**Purpose**  
To introduce myself as a developer and traveler, and to demonstrate my basic web design skills.

**Primary User Needs**
- Understand who I am and what I do.  
- Explore my gallery and personal interests.  
- Contact me easily through the website.

**Business Goals**  
Build an online presence, gain experience, and practice professional web structure and layout.

---

### 2. Scope

**Features**
- Header with name, navigation, and social links  
- Hero section with welcome message and “About Me” button  
- Four main pages: Home, About Me, Gallery, and Contact  
- Contact form and embedded Google Map  
- Footer with quick links and copyright section  

**Content Requirements**
- Short personal introduction  
- Section for skills and hobbies  
- Travel image gallery  
- Contact details and form  

---

### 3. Structure

**Information Architecture**
- **Navigation**: Fixed header links to all main pages  
- **Home**: Hero image, introduction, and quick links  
- **About Me**: Biography, skills, hobbies  
- **Gallery**: Travel photos  
- **Contact**: Contact form, info, and map  

**User Flow**
1. Home → sees hero section and welcome message  
2. About Me → learns about background, skills, hobbies  
3. Gallery → views travel photos  
4. Contact → fills out form or checks map  
5. 404 → For error url

### 4. Skeleton

- **Home Page**: Hero banner and brief introduction  
- **About Page**: Personal background, skills, hobbies  
- **Gallery Page**: Collection of travel photos  
- **Contact Page**: Contact form, info, and embedded Google Map  
- **Footer**: Quick links, social icons, and copyright  

---

### 5. Surface

**Visual Design**
**Colors:** The design uses a white background with soft neutral tones. Black and white combinations create a comfortable balance for the eyes, staying within the human comfort zone. Buttons use bordered text in some with white backgrounds and others with black for contrast.
- **Typography**: Sans-serif font for readability  
- **Layout**: Centered sections, balanced spacing, consistent alignment  
- **Images**: Personal travel photos for authenticity
