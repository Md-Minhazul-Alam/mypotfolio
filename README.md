This is my first **HTML and CSS portfolio website** project.  
It was built to showcase my identity, skills, and creativity as both a **traveler** and a **web developer**.  
The site includes multiple pages and a simple, responsive layout that adapts well across devices.

### 5. Surface

**Colors:** The design uses a white background with soft neutral tones. Black and white combinations create a comfortable balance for the eyes, staying within the human comfort zone. Buttons use bordered text in some with white backgrounds and others with black for contrast.
- **Typography**: Sans-serif font for readability  
- **Layout**: Centered sections, balanced spacing, consistent alignment  
- **Images**: Personal travel photos for authenticity
